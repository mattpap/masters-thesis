Polynomial manipulation algorithms
==================================

SymPy implements wide variety of algorithms for polynomials manipulation, which ranges from
polynomial arithmetics to advanced methods for factoring polynomials over algebraic number
fields or computing |groebner| bases. In this chapter we will give a short description to all
polynomial manipulation algorithms in SymPy. The descriptions will include a short note on the
purpose and applications of a particular algorithm, as well as discussion on its computational
complexity and possibility of parallelization. We will also give reference to most influential
papers, which were used for implementing polynomial related algorithms in SymPy.
