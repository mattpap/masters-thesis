/*
 *  bbold10/def.js
 *  
 *  This file loads the  font into jsMath. To do this use
 *  
 *      <SCRIPT>jsMath.Font.Load("bbold10")</SCRIPT>
 *
 *  after loading jsMath.js itself.  The user will need to have
 *  the bbold10.ttf font installed, otherwise corresponding unicode
 *  characters will be used, but the mapping is not perfect, and it is not 
 *  customized on a per-browser basis as it probably should be.
 *  
 *  If the font isn't installed, the user will receive a message indicating
 *  that fact, and pointing to the jsMath web site where the font can be
 *  downloaded.
 *  
 *  Once this file is loaded, you can use \char{bbold10}{nn} to access
 *  any character in the font.  In addition, the \bbold10 macro will switch to
 *  the eufm font
