Symbolic manipulation in pure Python. Is it feasible?
=====================================================

 Mateusz Paprocki, Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology

SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to
become a full-featured symbolic manipulation package while keeping
the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and
easily extensible.

The pure Python approach seems very promising, for example in teaching,
because it allows for investigation and modification of the implemented
methods in every detail. There is a concern, however, that a library
written entirely in an interpreted programming language and designated
for a computationally demanding task of symbolic manipulation, might be
not enough efficient for solving practical problems.

In this talk we will show, on a series of examples, that SymPy can be
used in various areas as a replacement for other mathematical software.
In parallel with this, we will examine SymPy's semantics and discuss
efficiency specific issues that arose during development. The talk will
be oriented towards computations with polynomials.
